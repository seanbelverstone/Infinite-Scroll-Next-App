This application was built to test out the functionality of using an infinite scroller. Using two different APIs allocated to a seperate page, they only load 100 results initially but upon reaching the bottom of the page, 100 more are rendered. The application was originally built with *Next* and *React*, but underwent conversion into using *Redux*, as shown in the commit history.
